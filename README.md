### A video processing app designed to consume videos to make compilations

This repo is currently under construction. If you'd like to try this out, place some videos (I've only tested mp4 so far) in the 'input-videos' folder. Run petal.py and a compilation will be outputted to the 'vid-to-upload' folder.
