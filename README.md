### A video processing app designed to consume videos to make compilations

To use this software, add some videos to the input videos folder and run the clip generator python script. A chopped up compilation video will be written to the 'vid-to-upload' folder. There isn't much pollish on this project, but it may serve as a starting point for anyone interested in automating video compilations.
